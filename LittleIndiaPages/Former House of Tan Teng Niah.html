          <p>Built in 1900, the former house of Tan Teng Niah is the last surviving Chinese villa in Little India. This house depicts an overlooked story between the industries which
            operated alongside the cattle and rattan businesses in Little India.
          </p>
          <p>Tan Niah was a towkay who owned several sweet-making factories along serrangoon road that used sugarcane to produce sweets.</p>
          <p>The house has eight rooms. The second storey overhangs the first to create a five-foot way where there was once an entrance portico. On both sides of the house, there used
            to be carriage gates leading into a courtyard.
