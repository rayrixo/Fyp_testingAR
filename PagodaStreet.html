    Trengganu Street connects four streets in Chinatown: Pagoda Street, Temple Street, Smith Street and Sago Street.3 Trengganu Street was well-known as the famous Lai Chun Yuen opera house was located at the junction of Smith Street and Trengganu Street.

<p style="font-size:20px;">
    Built in 1887, the opera house occupied a three-storey shophouse, and featured an 834-seat theatre. It was considered the Broadway or West End of Cantonese opera, and also hosted famous opera stars from China and Hong Kong.4

<p style="font-size:20px;">
    By the late 1920s, the theatre experienced a decline in popularity due to the introduction of motion pictures.5 A few months before World War II broke out, the theatre was rented to Shaw Brothers, which screened movies there. During the war, a bomb blast badly damaged the theatre. Post-war renovations were carried out, but by then, the building had become a merchandise shop and later a warehouse for street hawkers.6 During the Japanese Occupation, the block of flats that lined Trengganu Street, from Smith Street to Sago Street became home to Malay families who sought shelter and protection.7
