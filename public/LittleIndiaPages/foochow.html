        Former Kandang Kerbau Hospital

          <p>
            Built in 1860 to function as a general hospital, this hospital has witnessed the births of more Singaporeans than any other hospital on the island. The term of Kandang Kerbau (buffalo enclosure) is a reminder of the buffalos that were kept here
            a long time ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1997 the government decided to modernise KK hospital and hence relocated the hospital to a new building on the other side of Kampong Java Road. It was then renamed to KK Women's and Children's hopsital.
