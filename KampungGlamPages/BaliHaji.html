           The current Bali Lane and neighbouring Shaikh Madresah Lane which ran parallel to it made up the former Kampong Bali. The Kampong's development from the 1850s was partly due to the pilgrimage trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kampong Bali was where one of the first Bangsawan(Malay opera) troupes was formed in Singapore. For a period, the back of bali lane had stalls for horses, which were later converted to motorcar stalls
            in the early 20th century.
